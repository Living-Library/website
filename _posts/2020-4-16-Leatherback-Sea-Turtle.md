Recently in partnership with Digital Life 3D, I created this model of a juvenile sea turtle based on images of a living specimen. The model was sculpted, textured, baked, and animated in Blender for use in real-time render engines. The images above were rendered in Eevee.

The turtle was collected by Jeanette Wyneken (Florida Atlantic University) for her research on leatherback ecology and development, and the model was created in collaboration with the non-profit Upwell (https://www.upwell.org/).
