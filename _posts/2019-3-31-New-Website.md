Well, I finally created a legit website for myself. This site (johnsonlm.com) will be the new site for all my writing and the homebase for my online presence. So far, I'm keeping it simple. But who knows what else I might build out?!

For those interested in the technical details of the site, everything is build as a static site using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site generator and hosted on GitGub Pages. I also used the incredible [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme for the layout of the site. The working environment makes for a super easy blogging experience where I can write posts in Markdown and instantly commit them to the repositorym and thus the site, with a couple git commands.
