  Today I’m going to show you how to design and create the above graphic from scratch using Gravit Designer's powerful text and effect tools. I’ll cover everything from picking fonts, to adding a crinkled paper background using tileable textures. It’s going to be a fun project, so let’s get going! If you’ve never used Gravit Designer before, go ahead and grab yourself a copy from Designer.io or use the web app.
