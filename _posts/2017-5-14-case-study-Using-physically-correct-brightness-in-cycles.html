  In order to better understand the lighting system in the Cycles render engine, I've decided to dive into understanding how Cycles uses physically based units to accurately measure the intensity of emissive materials. On the surface, the values used by Cycles seem somewhat arbitrary. But digging deeper I've found that once again, Cycles has a facet of accuracy quite underestimated by the common user.
