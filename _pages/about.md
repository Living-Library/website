- *Animal-centric* - At our core, we are an animal-centric organization that looks to highlight the beauty of the nature world with as little filtering as possible. Nature is our inspiration and everything we do stems from our passion for recognizing these beautiful creatures.
- *Process Oriented* - Unlike traditional studios, we focus on the process of recreating life, rather than the end result. We believe that our work should mirror the evolving condition of the natural world. We enact this value through open-access sharing about our projects and by constantly revisiting our digital models as we seek to enrich the truthfulness of our work.
- *Conservation* - In a world where digital recreations attract attention often at the expense of their real-world counterparts, we want to transform our relationship with nature into a partnership. Instead of seeking to replace nature with our work we want to emphasize the irreplaceable aspects of nature in our digital recreations. We want to promote conservation through awareness, inspiration, and data collection.
- *Scientific Accuracy* - From the beginning, our team has strived to merge scientific accuracy with the artistic interpretation that is inherent to digital creations. We believe truthful representation is vital to protecting the image of the animals we represent. While not a research organization, the NPO will always hold the natural world as a benchmark for our work and utilize this as a way to create pioneering value to our organization.
